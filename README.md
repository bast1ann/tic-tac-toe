# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is part from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe), specifically the Javascript Course.

I'm gonna build a Tic Tac Toe Game that can be played from a web browser. The main goal is to organize the code, having as little global code as possible and use the design patterns learned in the last lesson of the course.

## LIVE PREVIEW

## Key Objectives
* Apply concepts on scoping, closures, factory functions and module patterns to organize the code.
